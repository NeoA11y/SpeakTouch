# Speak Touch
A open source screen reader for android.

## Build
In development, choose the *debug build type*, because for the *release build type*, it's necessary to create a [keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) and specify its properties in the `keystore.properties` file (use `keystore.properties.example` as a base).

### IDE
To build you need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases) (Flamingo or later).

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in the IDE.
3. Run the **app** module.
